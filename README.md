# Tee-Times-Hacker

## Description

A friend was struggling to lock down tee times online, so I decided to make a bot to navigate through the site and make clicks faster than an average user. This tool was especially useful while the pandemic was in full swing, and managed to snag dozens of tee times for many of my friends. It uses python and selenium to do the web crawling and has a simple and optional Tkinter based interface to go along with it.
